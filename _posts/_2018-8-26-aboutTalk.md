title: Some deep thought on speaking
---

I have prepared TOEFL for just one week. I didn't do much more than become family with the test structure and timing requerments. Because I had passed GRE test, I don't think it's diffcult for preparing TOEFL. Not suprisingly, it is exactly true when doing the reading and listening section. I got almost the same score on both sections about 26. But when I do the speacking secton, I found that I couldn't say a word about some familily topics been asking. Then, I thought I shout do more working on speaking. Speak aloud, and speak longly. :(

In fact, my speaking problem may not easy than it seems to be. I mean I couldn't say much words even using chinese. Such a shame, ah? The problem is when you meet your classmate for example, that you didn't say something may seems that you have some mental problem or you are rude or even a little emberrsment. But how could we development a sense of friendship especially with new friend? The key is speaking as much as you can. So you may seems easygoing.

Here comes the main point. In my opinion, taking with human being can be compared with two computers transfer data with each other. But talking's data transfer rate is much slower. And it more incline to contain some "useless word" such as "you know?" and so on. However, talking may be the most efficient way of communcaiton with each other. It is more easy to understand than watch books or something and foster good realionship.

That's being say: There is no gold road to Roman. There is no golden way to learn to speak. Just speaking as much and talk to different people. Correct the mistaks along the way. When they impress your speaking skills, you may make it then
