title: The meaning of life

### 1

Have you ever wondered what did those people who climb Mount Everest see when they get to the top? What did they think? Did they come to some grand realization? Did they suddenly say: "Yeah, I made it. I succeeded that life." ? And when they come down do you think there's newspapers waiting for them to publish their stories? No! What happen is they got to the top and feel great for a few minutes until despair and emptiness settles in. Then they think what now. 

They reach their ultimate goal in their life expecting all sorts of amazing things could happen. But it didn't.

Before that, the whole time they were working is the how. How do I get to the top? How do I check the weather? How do I make the transportation logistics work? How do I take time off? How do I raise enough money? All of this is about the how. But it's never really been about the why. When they get to the top no one cares. When they get to the bottom and tell people about the story but nobody cares. So it's not about the destination. It's about the journey. It's about the process going through the life.

People who were hoping that when they reach some level of success their life would become suddenly amazing but that's just not gonna turn out.

Have you ever played some video games and finally reach the highest level? Or you finally beat the game and unlock new features but find out you have lost all motivations to continue playing? You finally reach the goal, the thing you have been striving so much. But as soon as reach the highest level you just understand the game immediately. You are done. You just feel emptiness and despair like there was no point in the end.

Why did you work so hard and struggled throughout the whole things hoping it was going to fulfill you in some way but it left you feeling just empty.

A lot of people go though life struggling all the way hoping when hit retirement they are finally being able to enjoy life. By the time they get to retirement, they are going to be old and their body is going to be fragile. They may have time and money but they won't be able to use them.

When go to the office, you will see people who make twice as much as you. May be ten times or hundred times. Even these people who have reached bewildering levels of success that you can only dream about, you will find that they seem to be living very similar lives to you and me. They are going to the office Monday to Friday, eating the same food, using the same smartphones and living the same neighborhood as you and me.

When finally reach some level of success, you just quit everything. You get bored very quickly

What I just said is life. It already begun. You are the author of your own life. The meaning does not exist before you create it. You want to be proud of the steps taken when recount your story.

Finally, I would encourage you to focus not just on the goal but also the journey. Protect your time and make not just a good life but a great life!
