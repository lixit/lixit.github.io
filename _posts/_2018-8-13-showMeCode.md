As you can see, I wrote this in English. Although English is not my fist language, I will continue doing so. The main purpose of this are 1) There will be some foreifn audiences. They may read this some days. And 2) I never expect those who don't like English to agree with me.

Talking is something and writing is another. Just after my first blog, I soon realize I should be responsible for what I am writing.

I am not a web developer, and even don't know how to build this blog. I just imitate Peter's. I per se is a simple person or I intend to be as simple as possible. After I resign my first hardware engineering job, I sit in front of the computer day in and day out. And basically the computer just can do two things: do as what we told it and store the result excpet that machines do them very fast. Unlike the sentences we use daily, the program language just has one meaning. I am fond of this. It is exactly I want.

Be a programmer does have side effects. Talking to computer is nothing same as talking to human. The more curt words you use the more you seem to be rude. After you talk to computer all the day, you intendly or unintendly to talk to human the same way you treat computers. But not everyone are fond of programming(in fact the programmers seem less than I would expect). Eventually there will definitely be some estrangements between us.

The heading is quote from Linus, the creator of the Linux kernel. Actually I thought everyone should learn to code. Then their ideas(no matter what) can be realized. People from around the world contributed their ideas using the form of code. It's deep in mind.
