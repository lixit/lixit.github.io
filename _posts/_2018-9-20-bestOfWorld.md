title: A best-of-the-World list(continually update)
---

This post intends to provide a list of best resources that I ever used primarily from an aspect of programmers. However it also applies to others who want make their life easier.

In my point of view, a good product has features like simple, rugged and easy to maintain. So, for example, you don't like that you buy a car hoping to let it take you anywhere finally finding that it always has some shabby problems you have to repair every other day. Ironically, you, a master of your car, finally become a slave of it. That is clearly not what you intended to be.

Also, this is a unfinished list. I will continually update it. Feel free to contact me if you have thoughts about what to add on it and making it better.

## XPS15 95x0 or dell's precision mobile workstation
Best laptop I ever heard for prgramming. The workstation series give you more choices of which component to choose over xps series, however, both cases of the laptops are same.
note: x is a placeholder. Current version is 9570.

## Samsung's Galaxy S series smart phone
Best phone of the World. Although someone who may argue why it isn't their Apple product, I thought Apple's product is totally garbage. Apple's is over priced and it is close source trying to set up its own ecosystem. All of its software, connecting cables and so on are not compatible to rest of the world. As a programmer, I didn't give it a shit. These is more wonderful things I can explore than confine myself in its small cage. I didn't and will not try to do anything about it including but confining to develop softwares.

And that's it. If you don't want all sorts of useless accessories to bother you, it's clearly enough.

Later, I will update some best recourse and books for getting started with programming as well studying English guides. Hope to see you next time!
